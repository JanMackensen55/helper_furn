# How to Upload the Project to SosciSurvey

This tutorial shows the recommended way to setup the project in SosciSurvey. Inside the repository, there is a folder called **experiment** where the folders **strategy_game** and **ui** are located. Each folder contains the corresponding game as a SosciSurvey project file in XML format. This file can be uploaded directly with all required resources, questionnaire pages and variables.

**Even if you have made changes it is recommended to first upload the project and then overwrite the changed files. This way it is ensured that every other resource is uploaded correctly.**

 

### Create SosciSurvey Project

+ First, create a new Project in SosciSurvey (If you need help with that, consider the [official tutorial](https://www.soscisurvey.de/help/doku.php/en:start)) 
+ In the left sidebar navigate to Controls &rarr;Â Survey Project &rarr; Project Settings
+ Scroll to the bottom of the page and look in section **Export Project** for the option **Import Project or Questions**
