# Furniture Experiment Analyses #

### Complexity einordnen ###
- einordnung
- beschreibung
- how do people perform?
- strategy teaser
### Instance Complexity ###
- graphs: relation between solutions (?)
- solution space (how many similar solutions) (?)
- variation coefficients (?)
- Performance under optimal
- distance to LP solution
  - not ill-conditioned,good for informed strategies, this is what interests us
  - outlook: possibly adaptable
- **can be related to online hopefully after Prolific **
- ** how good is each decision**
  - in terms of performance that can still be reached
  - average performance of the posible solution?
  - **what is a good measure**
- **better measure for instance Complexity**
- **relate to algorithms**
- **heat map of chosen items**
- **similar subgroup analysis *
- **correlation between cost weight ratio**
- path number analysis relate to graphs
- **which items are safe in the solution, MKP**

### Online Strategies: Furniture Online ###
- explicit strategies and factors
  - **systematic overview, decomposition**
- validation of strategies with click data
- test of basic strategy performance
  - **more variations on strategies, with LPP**
- cluster analysis of solution paths in relation to strategies and performance




### Offline Search Strategies ###
- explicit  search strategies and factors
  - **systematic overview, decomposition**
- validation of strategies with click data
- analyse use of each search move
